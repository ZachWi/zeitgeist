# zeitgeist
A pet project I work on with spare time for school. plan on making it in just one C file for max spaghetti code.
To play: I've linked an executable for the C file that SHOULD work for most systems in interest of allowing everyone to play it, even without the curses lib on
their computer. 
For anyone interested, the compile function I use is the following: 
gcc -o zeitgeist -lncurses zeitgeist.c
